# Vertical Experiments - Documenting a Process

This is about the idea I had of using vertical gain, whether in hiking and or running on trails to accumulate elevation gain - or with rock climbing, _either in the gym or on actual rock outside_, in order to become healthier and more fit - both physically and mentally and emotionally and spirtually.

I want to see how it impacts my health and my life - and experiment with getting vertical gain regularly to see what positive benefits it can bring.

I am beginning this life style on the same day as my first commit to this repo - August 01, 2025.

I am building this with Vue and Nuxt and will discover more of the stack along the way :smiley:

Here goes, I am beginning my journey today :sweat_smile:
